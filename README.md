# Library Management System - Front-end (React)

This repository contains the *front-end* of a Library Management System developed during a two-week React training as part of a larger full-stack project. The front-end is a simple interface to display book information and manage users in the system.

## Project Overview

The main features of the React front-end include:
- A *home page* to display all available books in the system.
- *User sections* for managing authors, users, and reviews.
  
The project focuses on essential *React.js* concepts:
- Component-based architecture
- API calls to a back-end system for CRUD operations
- Basic state management

Since the focus of the overall project was primarily on back-end development, the front-end is kept minimal and does not include authentication or other advanced features.
